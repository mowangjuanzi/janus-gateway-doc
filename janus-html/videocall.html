<p>This is a simple video call plugin for Janus, allowing two WebRTC peers to call each other through the Janus core. The idea is to provide a similar service as the at the time well known (and now discontinued) AppRTC demo (<a href="https://github.com/webrtc/apprtc">https://github.com/webrtc/apprtc</a>), but with the media flowing through a server rather than being peer-to-peer.</p>
<p>The plugin provides a simple fake registration mechanism. A peer attaching to the plugin needs to specify a username, which acts as a "phone number": if the username is free, it is associated with the peer, which means he/she can be "called" using that username by another peer. Peers can either "call" another peer, by specifying their username, or wait for a call. The approach used by this plugin is similar to the one employed by the echo test one: all frames (RTP/RTCP) coming from one peer are relayed to the other.</p>
<p>Just as in the <a class="el" href="janus__videocall_8c.html" title="Janus VideoCall plugin.">janus_videocall.c</a> plugin, there are knobs to control whether audio and/or video should be muted or not, and if the bitrate of the peer needs to be capped by means of REMB messages.</p>

Video Call API</h1>
<p>All requests you can send in the Video Call API are asynchronous, which means all responses (successes and errors) will be delivered as events with the same transaction.</p>
<p>The supported requests are <code>list</code> , <code>register</code> , <code>call</code> , <code>accept</code> , <code>set</code> and <code>hangup</code> . <code>list</code> allows you to get a list of all the registered peers; <code>register</code> can be used to register a username to call and be called; <code>call</code> is used to start a video call with somebody through the plugin, while <code>accept</code> is used to accept the call in case one is invited instead of inviting; <code>set</code> can be used to configure some call-related settings (e.g., a cap on the send bandwidth); finally, <code>hangup</code> can be used to terminate the communication at any time, either to hangup an ongoing call or to cancel/decline a call that hasn't started yet.</p>
<p>The <code>list</code> request has to be formatted as follows:</p>
<pre class="fragment">{
        "request" : "list"
}
</pre><p>A successful request will result in an array of peers to be returned:</p>
<pre class="fragment">{
        "videocall" : "event",
        "result" : {
                "list": [       // Array of peers
                        "alice78",
                        "bob51",
                        // others
                ]
        }
}
</pre><p>An error instead (and the same applies to all other requests, so this won't be repeated) would provide both an error code and a more verbose description of the cause of the issue:</p>
<pre class="fragment">{
        "videocall" : "event",
        "error_code" : &lt;numeric ID, check Macros below&gt;,
        "error" : "&lt;error description as a string&gt;"
}
</pre><p>To register a username to call and be called, the <code>register</code> request can be used. This works on a "first come, first served" basis: there's no authentication involved, you just specify the username you'd like to use and, if free, it's assigned to you. Notice that there's no way to unregister: you have to close the handle to free the username. The <code>register</code> request has to be formatted as follows:</p>
<pre class="fragment">{
        "request" : "register",
        "username" : "&lt;desired unique username&gt;"
}
</pre><p>If successful, this will result in a <code>registered</code> event:</p>
<pre class="fragment">{
        "videocall" : "event",
        "result" : {
                "event" : "registered",
                "username" : "&lt;same username, registered&gt;"
        }
}
</pre><p>Once you're registered, you can either start a new call or wait to be called by someone else who knows your username. To start a new call, the <code>call</code> request can be used: this request must be attached to a JSEP offer containing the WebRTC-related info to setup a new media session. A <code>call</code> request has to be formatted as follows:</p>
<pre class="fragment">{
        "request" : "call",
        "username" : "&lt;username to call&gt;"
}
</pre><p>If successful, this will result in a <code>calling</code> event:</p>
<pre class="fragment">{
        "videocall" : "event",
        "result" : {
                "event" : "calling",
                "username" : "&lt;same username, registered&gt;"
        }
}
</pre><p>At the same time, the user being called will receive an <code>incomingcall</code> event</p>
<pre class="fragment">{
        "videocall" : "event",
        "result" : {
                "event" : "incomingcall",
                "username" : "&lt;your username&gt;"
        }
}
</pre><p>To accept the call, the <code>accept</code> request can be used. This request must be attached to a JSEP answer containing the WebRTC-related information to complete the actual PeerConnection setup. A <code>accept</code> request has to be formatted as follows:</p>
<pre class="fragment">{
        "request" : "accept"
}
</pre><p>If successful, both the caller and the callee will receive an <code>accepted</code> event to notify them about the success of the signalling:</p>
<pre class="fragment">{
        "videocall" : "event",
        "result" : {
                "event" : "accepted",
                "username" : "&lt;caller username&gt;"
        }
}
</pre><p>At this point, the media-related settings of the call can be modified on either side by means of a <code>set</code> request, which acts pretty much as the one in the <a class="el" href="echotest.html#echoapi">Echo Test API</a> . The <code>set</code> request has to be formatted as follows. All the attributes (except <code>request</code>) are optional, so any request can contain a subset of them:</p>
<pre class="fragment">{
        "request" : "set",
        "audio" : true|false,
        "video" : true|false,
        "bitrate" : &lt;numeric bitrate value&gt;,
        "record" : true|false,
        "filename" : &lt;base path/filename to use for the recording&gt;,
        "substream" : &lt;substream to receive (0-2), in case simulcasting is enabled&gt;,
        "temporal" : &lt;temporal layers to receive (0-2), in case simulcasting is enabled&gt;,
        "fallback" : &lt;How much time (in us, default 250000) without receiving packets will make us drop to the substream below&gt;
}
</pre><p><code>audio</code> instructs the plugin to do or do not relay audio frames; <code>video</code> does the same for video; <code>bitrate</code> caps the bandwidth to force on the browser encoding side (e.g., 128000 for 128kbps); <code>record</code> enables or disables the recording of this peer; in case recording is enabled, <code>filename</code> allows to specify a base path/filename to use for the files (-audio.mjr, -video.mjr and -data.mjr are automatically appended). Beware that enabling the recording only records this user's contribution, and not the whole call: to record both sides, you need to enable recording for both the peers in the call. Finally, in case the call uses simulcasting, <code>substream</code> and <code>temporal</code> can be used to manually pick which substream and/or temporal layer should be received from the peer.</p>
<p>A successful request will result in a <code>set</code> event:</p>
<pre class="fragment">{
        "videocall" : "event",
        "result" : {
                "event" : "set"
        }
}
</pre><p>Notice that the <code>set</code> request is also what you use when you want to renegotiate a session, e.g., for the purpose of adding/removing media streams or forcing an ICE restart. In that case, even an empty <code>set</code> request is fine, as long as it accompanies a new JSEP offer or answer (depending on who originated the session update). The user receiving the updated JSEP offer/answer will get an <code>update</code> event:</p>
<pre class="fragment">{
        "videocall" : "event",
        "result" : {
                "event" : "update",
        }
}
</pre><p>To decline an incoming call, cancel an attempt to call or simply hangup an ongoing conversation, the <code>hangup</code> request can be used, which has to be formatted as follows:</p>
<pre class="fragment">{
        "request" : "hangup"
}
</pre><p>Whatever the reason of a call being closed (e.g., a <code>hangup</code> request, a PeerConnection being closed, or something else), both parties in the communication will receive a <code>hangup</code> event:</p>
<pre class="fragment">{
        "videocall" : "event",
        "result" : {
                "event" : "hangup",
                "username" : "&lt;username of who closed the communication&gt;",
                "reason" : "&lt;description of what happened&gt;"
        }
}
</pre>
